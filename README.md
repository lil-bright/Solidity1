Associated Profit Splitter: 
- Once money goes into the firm, it is immediately transmitted to the various 3 employees at the same rate. There should never be a balance in the address. 

Tiered Profit Splitter:
- Takes total profits from a firm and distributes them based upon a % basis to various employees at different pay rates. Anything leftover goes to the highest ranking employee.

Deffered Equity Plan:
- controlled by human resources, this deffered equity plan distributes shares to employees over a 4 year basis until they are fully vested. Once the 4 year time period is up the employee shares have vested and they are able to fully convert them over to their personal assets. If for some reason the employee leaves prior to shares vesting, they will return to company ownership.
